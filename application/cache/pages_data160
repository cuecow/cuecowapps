For example one of the things that has separated the South Florida Business League from the rest of the networking groups in Palm Beach, Broward and Dade counties is our reliance on technology and the interactive website developed specifically for the group. While many traditional networking groups rely on word of mouth to generate referrals for the group's members, the SFBL has made a name for itself utilizing web optimization to drive traffic to each member's individual website.

Another difference between the South Florida Business League and traditional "networking groups" is the mind-set of the members. SFBL meetings are meant to be productive and as a group we strive to minimize distractions. While many traditional networking groups schedule their meetings around breakfast or lunch the SFBL has made it a point not to permit food at our meetings. With just Two (2) One-Hour meetings a month it is imperative that we spend every minute of our time together getting to know one other, about each other's businesses, and how each member can go about generating more business for the other members of the group.

While it would be easy to continue rattling off differences between traditional "networking groups" and the South Florida Business League, you'd have a much harder time trying to find similarities. The South Florida Business League generates more referrals, has a larger network of professionals, has a better reputation for providing service and is more motivated to service the local community in which we live. There is no comparison.
